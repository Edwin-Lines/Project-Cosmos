# Additional Elements
As the development phase ends, we reflect onto the habilities hardskills/softskills we accomplished and that can be summarized as follows:

## Softskills
Explaining software engineering concepts in plain english; team communication and organization; time management and design/look-and-feel concepts to enhance UX. We
also worked in conveying abstract ideas like class diagrams, code implementation and user interactions with the system in simple ideas and representations. 
And finally we all developed creativity in many aspects, like avoiding the bot reading itself or user authentification or the logo for the project and 
organization of many artifacts in small presentations; without overlooking our accent and english grammar might have been positively impacted.

## Hardskills
For the implementation we worked with some technologies before being implemented in the course or out of the scope completely. We connected the bot with a free
cloud in Heroku in order to store our database, and had to migrate the databse using MySQL in local host to Postgres in the cloud and adpating and refactoring
the .properties files learning their immense value and the functions that manipulated the database.

We also learned more features like collections, hash mapping and classes relations in java and also played with the idea of a 
remote bot, hosted in replit using a https server pinged by an outsider provider in order to keep it alive but moved into java for better knwoledge of it.

We think the job meets our criteria of full acceptance and as interesting ideas we could integrate MongoDB if wanted to expand the project and make it cross-platform
in new ways.
