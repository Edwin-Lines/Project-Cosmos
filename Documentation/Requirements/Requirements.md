# Requirements

To establish the functional and non-functional requirements, we took into account 
the answers we obtained through a survey we conducted with students from the 3rd semester of 
the Faculty of Mathematics.

![Survey](https://github.com/Edwin-Lines/Project-Cosmos/blob/main/Resources/Images/SURVEY_IMAGE_2.jpg)

According to the answers on a scale of 1 to 10 students think on average that 7.61 is the rating 
of how interesting the idea is and would be willing to participate on average from 1 to 10 : 6.86


We also talked with an expert in the area of psychology, and he explained to us that the project is a 
good idea, but we had to direct it towards a more positive aspect, to avoid touching on sensitive issues.
And create a more community-friendly space.
