# Requirement Validation
According to the [requirement document](https://github.com/Edwin-Lines/Project-Cosmos/blob/Third-Deadline/Documentation/Requirements/Requirements.md), we had to validate those both the functional and non-functional requirements, so, once the bot's project was completed, the only process left was to check and mark those requirements that were indeed achieved.
This was validated through a team meeting in which the bot was put into test to see all the functionalities it had and to see if it was able to successfully complete all the [user stories](https://github.com/Edwin-Lines/Project-Cosmos/blob/Third-Deadline/Documentation/Use%20Cases%20Diagram%2C%20User%20Stories%20%26%20Use%20Scenarios/User%20Stories.md) and [user cases](https://github.com/Edwin-Lines/Project-Cosmos/blob/Third-Deadline/Documentation/Use%20Cases%20Diagram%2C%20User%20Stories%20%26%20Use%20Scenarios/USE%20CASE%201.pdf) that were planted as part of the documentation.
Finally, once seen that it completed each case and follow the requirements in a optimize and correctly way, me marked the requirements as fulfilled and validated.
