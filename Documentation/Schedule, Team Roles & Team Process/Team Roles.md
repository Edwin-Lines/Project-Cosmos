# **Team Roles and Tasks** 

Role division and task assignation are organized as follow:  
* Edwin: *Team leader/development member*
* Fernan: *Development lider*
* Karyme: *Documentation lider/development member*
* Geovanna: *Documentation member/development member*

For each member of the team, a task is assigned to them according to the capacities and abilities that has each member. As such, each task has a priority and complexity identified, as these ones are divided between all members keeping a balanced in amount of work that each member receives. 

For this, the tool of Trello is used to organize and register the tasks that are completed for each member. In this tool, each task allows the use of checklists, tags, and specific dates in which a task must be completed, simplifying the understanding of the task; as well, a person in charge is named for the task according to its role in the team. 

Using this role division and tool, an individual contribution document can be created in which the team can use metrics such as the number of hours that are needed and used for each task, making the measurement of individual percentage in the project possible as shown in the next tracker:
