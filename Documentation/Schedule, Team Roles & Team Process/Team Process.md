# **Team Process**

## Process
In this project we will be making use of the agile Kanban methodology since it provides a greater number of advantages within the type of project we are handling, being more visual and offering an easy understanding of use by using charts or diagrams for the division of tasks assignment, whether they are pending, in process or finished.

- **Quality guaranteed:** This methodology is not based on a principle of speed, but rewards the quality of the tasks performed; thus, at the time of applying each of the tasks, a review of the completed task is provided both by the team of developers, and by the team leader.
- **Continuous improvement:** Kanban is presented as a system of improvement in the development of projects according to the established objectives to be achieved; this allows the continuous implementation of modifications both to the product and development process.
- **Flexibility:** This methodology offers the opportunity to make certain changes according to the needs of the moment, and this can be seen directly at the time of the organization of tasks, as they may have planned a period of time for some tasks without taking into account that some situation may arise where it is necessary to reorganize the priority of the same; this is a very important utility within this project.

## Methods and tools
### Organization, monitoring and task/jobs management: Trello
By working using the *Trello* tool, we have been able to elaborate cards with the tasks or roles of each member while showing the importance of the same, being that this is available to all team members, thus avoiding the repetition of tasks or the possibility of forgetting any of them, making our productivity and efficiency to improve when working as a team.
Also, by offering specific advantages such as the following, we have considered that it will provide us with greater organization within the development of the project.
* Tasks planning
* Improved work performance of the team
* Visual metrics
* Continuous delivery times

* **Tasks planning:** Through note cards you can assign tasks, the person to do the task, the importance of the task, the process of the task, set dates for completion and even customize tags for easy organization of the team.

* **Statistics and graphs:** This platform offers the use of graphics to adapt the information in a more easily understandable way and adds the tasks to a calendar.

### Communication: Whatsapp, Teams & Discord
We used Whastapp and Discord as communication tools in the team, mainly because of the ease that both have for their management. Both offer the main functions of messaging and calling, being that one is used for quick messages and notifications, and the other platform for meetings and main ideas of the project, so we were able to adapt the following functionalities for its management:
* **Messaging:** Most of the team is more connected or present on Whatsapp, so we use this application to agree on meeting dates or some quick messages of notices; Discord, on the other hand, we use it mainly to give the ideas we have about the project or the modifications we could make within it by offering the various sections that one can customize within a server.

* **Calls:** We use Discord for meetings, since it is easier to use and uses fewer resources when making calls.

* **Meetings with the mentor:** Teams allows us to schedule calls and organize our time with respect to our academic activities; it is a robust platform, with no time limits, permissions and easy to use.
