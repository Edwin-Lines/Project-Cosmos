## Description
“Project Cosmos” is a project about creating a complementing tool that offers a space for students to share their stories and experiences to other students to motivate readers to work harder. This project allows a healthy exchange of experiences in a common academic platform, in this case Microsoft Teams, so student can have a space available to advice other people and even tell interesting stories they have lived through out this year.

## Users
The users are teachers who use Microsoft Teams as the platform for online classes that want students to have an extra way to motivate themselves by reading positive stories or experiences from a personal or academic point of view while seeing possible advice that could be taken from them.
